As you can see in above picture, you can change the colors of the animated person, set the Trackable to which the duration of the workout should be logged and include a default sentence in the log to Nomie which can include the parameters '7minswo' for the workout type and 'duration' for the duration of the workout. Just place these keywords between <>.

I guess there is nothing more to add for this plugin.

As always.....just enjoy and have fun with it!
